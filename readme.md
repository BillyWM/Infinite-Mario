A copy of the code for "Infinite Mario Brothers".
Originally written by Markus "Notch" Persson (a.k.a the Minecraft guy).
Converted from Java to AS3 by a Japanese programmer known only - as far as I can tell - as "Flashrod"

Code originally by Notch, and released into the public domain (see doc/LICENSE.txt)
Flash conversion, apparently, also released into the public domain. (see doc/README_ja_JP_utf8.txt)
I don't speak Japanese, but I believe he said his code is "under the same license" (either that, or he called my mother a whore)


I've uploaded it to make a few tweaks:

- Working score
- Spinies die from fire
- Power down on death
- Levels don't change when you re-enter them
- Less Bullet Bills, more pits
- More 1-Ups

My contributions are also released back into the public domain.
