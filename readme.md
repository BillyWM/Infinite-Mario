# 2021

Notch is a complete and utter massive shithead. But I'll be keeping this code up anyway. Historical reasons or whatever. Some people starred and forked and I don't want to yank the rug out from under them.

Original readme follows. Links all dead now. Updated to Wayback Machine copies.

A copy of the code for "Infinite Mario Brothers".
Originally written by Markus "Notch" Persson (a.k.a the Minecraft guy).
Converted from Java to AS3 by a Japanese programmer known only - as far as I can tell - as "Flashrod"

Images and sounds are copyright Nintendo. You should replace them with original content!

Code originally by Notch, and released into the public domain (see [doc/LICENSE.txt](doc/LICENSE.txt))

Flash conversion, apparently, also released into the public domain. (see [doc/README_ja_JP_utf8.txt](doc/README_ja_JP_utf8.txt))

I don't speak Japanese, but I believe his readme says his code is "under the same license" as the original


I've uploaded it to make a few tweaks:

- Levels don't change when you re-enter them
- Working score
- Spinies die from fire
- Power down on death
- Less Bullet Bills, more pits
- Buzzy Beetles

My contributions are also released back into the public domain.
